Hello, assessors. The folders to examine are Scripts, Scenes, and Prefabs.

Within the Scenes, please review the Demo Scene and Main Menu. The Main Menu serves as the game's starting point.

For the Scripts, focus on the Combat Scripts, Inventory Scripts, NPC Scripts, Player Scripts, Real Map Generation Code, and Save Mechanics.
